# difesa-cittadella

Name: Protect your citadel

Date: Mar 2010 â€“ May 2010

Description: Development of an OpenGL game as project for Computer Graphics unit of study.

Game description:
It's a first person game, which displays a three-dimensional landscape, illuminated by a light source ("Sun"). This landscape is composed of a large terrain on which there is the "citadel", a set of at least ten textured objects in the shape of a parallelepiped, representing skyscrapers/buildings.
The position of the observer is few meters above the level of the ground and far away from the citadel and he has available an anti-aircraft cannon.
The purpose of the game is protect the citadel against the bombs falling on it, intercepting them and destroy the alien space ships (moving the cannon via keyboard). These latter are moving at high speed when escaping from the citadel zone. On the opposite, space ships move slowly when flying over their aim zone. Constraints of the game are the recharging time of the cannon, and its slight slowness on movement. The game ends when all the space ships have been destroyed, or citadel has been deeply damaged.

Used Eclipse IDE for C++ Developers and GLUT OpenGL library.
